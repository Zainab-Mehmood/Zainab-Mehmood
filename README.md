Code Explanation

Functions

setColor(color)

This function accepts a character and sets the terminal text color based on:

r = Red

g = Green

b = Blue

p = Purple

y = Yellow

Default or other characters = White (default terminal color)

Workflow

The program prompts the user for a sentence.

It loops through each character in the input:

If the character matches one of the predefined color keys, it sets the corresponding color.

Otherwise, it uses the default color.

It prints the sentence with the appropriate colors applied.

Code

Here is the Python script:

# Function for adding colors.
def setColor(color):
    if color == "r":
        print("\033[31m", end='')  # Red
    elif color == "g":
        print("\033[32m", end='')  # Green
    elif color == "b":
        print("\033[34m", end='')  # Blue
    elif color == "p":
        print("\033[35m", end='')  # Purple
    elif color == "y":
        print("\033[33m", end='')  # Yellow
    elif color == "":
        print("\033[0m", end='')  # Default or White

print("What sentence do you want rainbow-ising?")
sentence = input()
print()

# Loop through each character in the sentence.
for letter in sentence:
    if letter.lower() in ['r', 'g', 'b', 'p', 'y']:
        setColor(letter.lower())
    else:
        setColor("")
    print(letter, end='')

# Reset the terminal color to default.
setColor("")
print()
